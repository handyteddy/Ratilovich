<p>Simply searchsploit ‘HFS 2.3’ or search within the metasploit framework to find the vulnerability for ‘Rejetto_hfs_exec’. Set the parameters that would fit the host and execute for a user shell.</p>
<h1 id="privilege-escalation">Privilege escalation</h1>
<p>Since we have a meterpreter shell, we can leverage the classic ‘windows-exploit-suggester’ module. We run it and it returns some results. ‘Microsoft Windows 8.1 (x64) ‘RGNOBJ’ Integer Overflow (MS16-098)’ is one of them. 
We can download an executable from the offensive security github page and simply transfer and execute the binary on the host to gain SYSTEM permissions.</p>
