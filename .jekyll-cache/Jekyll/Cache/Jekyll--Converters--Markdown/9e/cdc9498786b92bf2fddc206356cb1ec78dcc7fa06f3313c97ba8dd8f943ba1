<p>directory bruteforcing reveals <strong>/dev/phpbash.php</strong> which is by name the program listed on the index. This can also be found by tracing the devs github page.</p>

<p>I chose to upload a shell to the server using a http server and wget on the box, navigating to a php shell gives us our connection. A python pty shell can be spawed for a nicer environment. 
We notice a <strong>scriptmanager</strong> user and <strong>/scripts</strong> directory on the machine. With some su-foo we can move into be scriptmanager.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo -u scriptmanager (sudo -u scriptmanager /bin/sh -i)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now we can access the /scripts directory we see a python script we can edit. Changing the script to contain a basic python reverse shell and opening a listener on our host will result in a shell.</p>
