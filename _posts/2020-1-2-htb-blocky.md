Blocky was another standard box with a few potential rabbit holes to fall down. There was also a 2nd potential method of gaining information through phpmyadmin which i didnt investigate.
# Nmap scan

```
Directories mention 'wp-content' and 'wp-includes' which are wordpress directories so theres a solid chance we will be interacting with wordpress.

# User enumeration
Since we know wordpress is running, we can enumerate the site with wpscan. Wpscan manages to pull the username 'notch' from the rss feed.

# Initial shell
Going back to recon through the 'plugins' directory we get access to a 'cute file browser' with 2 files:
```
- Blockycore.jar
- griefprevention.jar
```
We can use online decompilers to decompile the java into somewhat readable code.
From the blockycore file we get credentials that are hardcoded.
{% highlight java %}
public class BlockyCore {
public String sqlHost = "localhost";
public String sqlUser = "root";
public String sqlPass = "8YsqfCTnvxAUeduzjNSXe22";
{% endhighlight %}

Logging in to ssh with user 'notch' and that password gives us our foothold and user flag.

# Privilege escalation
A sudo check reveals instantly what our method of gaining root privs will be.
```console
notch@Blocky:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for notch: <ssh_pw>
Matching Defaults entries for notch on Blocky:
env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User notch may run the following commands on Blocky:
(ALL : ALL) ALL
```
'sudo su' gives us root.
