## Rise in Malicious Chat bots - a UBA case study
# Part 1 - Introduction
<br>
Since the inception of web automations in the 2010's and the increasing need for customer retention through exceptional customer service 
many companies have leveraged several business feature of social networks to promptly address customer griviances and difficulties

but with the adoption  of new technologies comes the avenue for exploitation by threat actors, 
<br>
one very good business feature of Social media networks from the Meta family of companies Messenger, Instagram , 
WhatsApp to other in instant messeging category like Telegram and discord 
have in recent years rolled out business features which includes ChatBot  , which is a piece of automated messaging software that uses 
artificial intelligence to converse with customers
<br>
Threats actors have indeed weaponise this features for use in phishing campaigns and sometimes Command and Control. In this article would
drill in on a somewhat advance campaign masqurading as a renouned bank in africa, UBA and harvesting debit card information and well as its corresponding 2FA 

As an average bank account owner with some banking difficulties, going on to messenger with the intentions of seeking customer service, you come across two ChatBots 
<br>

<br>
interacting with the first proved abortive as the agents are busy but a second identical ChatBots offers to resolve your issues by asking you to ‚ÄúFollow A Link‚Äù rectify your request 


 <img src="/assets/images/bankchatbot/1s.png" height="100%" width="100%">
<br>
upon folowing  the links we are greeted with a ‚ÄúNot so obvious‚Äù phish page requsting for 
‚Ä¢ Account Number
‚Ä¢ Card Number
‚Ä¢ Expiration Date
‚Ä¢ CCV
‚Ä¢ PIN
<br>

traditonally this compromise of the above information would'nt be a problem as the malicious subject cannot get the bank to authorise transactions by suppliyng card details,
Credit, Debit card issuers have additional layers of authentication for approval of transations
Visa has Verified By Visa, Mastercard has SecureCode By Mastercard, a lot of local nigerian banks have The OTP (One Time Password)  whic is a private code
or  unique password that gives you added protection against unauthorized  use of your card when making payments or shopping online. 
 <br>
 to get around layer of authentication, the actors have ‚Äúman in the middled‚Äù the campaign by also requesting you for an OTP on the instant, then using your OTP they can authorise trasactions,

 If you wonder how they can achieve this in real time ... Read further 
 
 after submission of a One Time Password we are greeted with a success page [[more like  good luck your account has been emptied LOL]]

##Part 2 - Some technical analysis
<br>
Now to the fun part, as a jobless hacker that i am :), i initiated the weapon of mass destruction: My brain,  attacked the web application and got into the server. 
It was quite dissapointing to realise its a shared hosting but nevertheless this privilege gave me access to the campaign materials and data which would enable us see how the campaign operates
<br>
For the sake TL;DR, illl be skippin alot of pages and only focusing on the some key functions
 <br>
firsty we get to see how successful this campaign has been with some card details and coresponding OTP 
<img src="/assets/images/bankchatbot/logs.png" height="100%" width="100%">
 <br>

The index page calls login.php and generates a randon md5 string for use a session identifier
 <img src="/assets/images/bankchatbot/indexsource.png" height="100%" width="100%">
 <br>
 In login.php we are concerned with the form action to determins where the posted data is being sent to, in this case as you can see below the Mail1.php 
 handles the supplied data
 <img src="/assets/images/bankchatbot/loginsource.png" height="100%" width="100%">
 <br>
  To my surpise the doesnt work like a traditional phishing kit that sends harvested data to an email address using the phpmailer function, 
  this kit leverages Telegrams ChatBot API to instantanously notify the attacker of a submision
 <img src="/assets/images/bankchatbot/mail1source.png" height="100%" width="100%">
 <br>
 
 
1. Telegrams API endpoint
2. Parameter supplies to the endpoint
3. Harvested data sent along with the post request
4. The OTP page in which the victim would be redirected to for harvesting the authenication codes
 
 looking at the OTP/email verification page, we can see the formaction to be mail2.php
<img src="/assets/images/bankchatbot/otpsource.png" height="100%" width="100%">
 <br>
mail2.php is identical to mail1.php. as its send the supplied OTP to the attacker's telegram group in real time
  <img src="/assets/images/bankchatbot/mail2source.png" height="100%" width="100%">
 <br>
 
1. Ability to send data to Telegram or Discord
2. After OTP submisson you get redirected to a prof.php page

prof.php is the success page that stays up for a 3.5 seconds before redirecting to the legitmate url for the UBA
 
 <img src="/assets/images/bankchatbot/profsource.png" height="100%" width="100%">
 <br>
 
 some other features of this kit are as below
 <img src="/assets/images/bankchatbot/anidetect1.png" height="100%" width="100%">
 <br>
 1. The blacklist.php reads several IP's of a bot.txt text file  and block access for those address
 2. The Bot-Crawler.php continully harvest address of known bots and append the to the bot.txt file
 3. Bot-Spox is quite interesting as its harvest new bots as well
 4. Dila_DZ Perform a HTTP REFERER check on the visitor to see if they are coming from the Phishtank website
 5. IP-Blacklist blocks access for hardcoded IP ranges
 
 And the interesting stuff never ends
 
  <img src="/assets/images/bankchatbot/anidetect2.png" height="100%" width="100%">
 <br>
1. Checks the validity of the card you supplied by looking up the BIN in a bin database
2. Checks the Operating System the supplier uses and determine if its blockworthy or not [FU.php lol]
 
 I was also able to get the telegram bots token and chat ID which could be used to social engineer the actor and maybe figure those behind 
<img src="/assets/images/bankchatbot/tokensource.png" height="100%" width="100%">
 <br>
 
  but like cybersecurity folks like to say ‚ÄúYou need permission, bla bla bla, yada yada yada‚Äù. ü§¶  ü§¶  ü§¶  if not *weyrey wan le gan*
 <br>
 
 
 Now you might wonder how the attacker makes money from all this, they may use your card in real time and link to services like Quickteller, OPay, Jumia, Aliexpress  etc, 
 verify with your supplied OTP then use such accounts for bill payments, purchases and/or withdrawals
 
# Part 2 - Countermeasure
 <br>
 
Technically
Technically this success of this campaign and similars ones is in no way the fault of the company being impersonated in this case UBA, as it is a bank well known for its strong cybersecurity posture
but a lot of research need to be done in the field of authentication and payment processing, OTP are facing out as there are TOTP, HOTP and authentications like FaceID and so one

but as always the best line of defence against phishing is awareness and training hence the need for more articles like this one
