    8  Bashed was a very easy box, perfect for anyone getting started with htb.

    8  Beep was a very easy box with not much to learn. Would have liked to see more complex methods included as the initial vector was different and could have led to more interesting things.

    8  Blocky was another standard box with a few potential rabbit holes to fall down. There was also a 2nd potential method of gaining information through phpmyadmin which i didnt investigate.

    8  This was actually the first box i touched after getting on the htb platform. I couldnt work out how to root it at the time but after a few weeks i came back to figure it out.

    8  Sense was another box that you can smash out in 10 minutes you might have spare. Not much to be learnt from this one as it was very straight forward.

    8  Solid state was the first box i did on htb that had the vector of email harvesting, learnt a lot about what not to keep in emails .

    8  Vault is easily one of my favourite boxes on htb. It taught me a lot about tunneling and moving through a network any way possible. This is one of the boxes i got truely stuck into for days and could not stop thinking about what the next move was.
