# Webapp things
'/torrent' from the directory bruteforce looks interesting, it directs to a torrent hosting site. There is capability to upload files but we cant due to being unauthenticated. Luckily theres also a signup form so we can be authenticated.
Attempting a straight file upload with a php shell and typical bypasses didnt end up working out. Since the name mentions torrents, i tried a torrent file such as the default kali torrent. This file works just fine. After uploading theres an option to upload an image along with the file. This time appending .png to our php shell allows us to get a connection once we navigate to '/torrent/uploads'


# Getting root
Digging around searchsploit and exploitdb for a kernel exploit was an idea because the kernel is dated as 2009. 
```
“Linux Kernel 2.6.37 (RedHat / Ubuntu 10.04) - 'Full-Nelson.c' Local Privilege Escalation”
``` 
Use wget on the box to get the file, compile and execute to gain root.
```
