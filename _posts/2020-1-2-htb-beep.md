Beep was a very easy box with not much to learn. Would have liked to see more complex methods included as the initial vector was different and could have led to more interesting things.

# Exploitation
We can see from the nmap scan and from navigating the page that the webserver is running elastix. A exploit-db search for elastix returns a local file inclusion that should reveal a user login and password from a config file.
```
Elastix 2.2.0 - 'graph.php' Local File Inclusion | exploits/php_webapps/37637.pl
```
Reading the exploit and grabbing the payload we can navigate back to the page and read the config file with the LFI
```
/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//etc/amportal.conf%00&module=Accounts&action
```
There are passwords in the config file as expected, next we can change the LFI to point to /etc/passwd to check for user accounts to try ssh with.

sshing into the box as root with the password from the config file works and we can collect our root and user flags.
